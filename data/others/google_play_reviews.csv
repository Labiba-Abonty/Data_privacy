Google Play,d04bf697-916d-497b-a9b2-c03723563dd9,A Google user,,"Helpful, but could be improved. 1) bills/expenses on the last day of the month often don't show up in ""upcoming bills"", I'm assuming because there's 28, 30, or 31 days in the month. The solution to this is upgrading to plus and adding it in as a cash bill. 2) would be great to be able to split a single purchase between two or more categories for more accurate data. So if you buy a card and gift while grocery shopping, you could categorize appropriately instead of adding it in as a note on the purchase. 3) rolling over income and bills into the next month. Everything is month-based in this app, but a lot of people probably have bills/expenses that occur on the 1st day of the month. But these bills aren't shown or calculated in ""upcoming bills"". 4) would be nice to have a calendar view of bills and income for people that don't like lists. Overall, a very helpful app. These are just suggestions to improve that I've noticed after using this app for multiple months. It gives a great snapshot of your finances and it's so incredibly helpful that you don't have to manually enter every purchase because it pulls data from your bank account.

Not enough flexibility in the INSIGHT category to choose which categories display for your review. The CASH account option (which is a pay only option) is very useful for my tastes and the only thing that really stands out to me, but hardly worth paying for. I can keep track of the physical cash in my pocket just fine on my own, I don't need to pay PocketGuard to do it for me! Plus, while it's cool that an ATM Withdrawal will automatically prompt the app to give you the choice to add that cash to your CASH account, it doesn't work in the reverse, where a cash DEPOSIT to an ATM account should prompt you to choose to deduct that amount from your CASH account.  In fact, the ONLY reason I would pay to use this app from month to month or annually is if it included a feature to EXPORT reports of my expenses based on the categories that I chose. Otherwise, Mint is much more comprehensive and useful. Not a bad app to start with but they're not quite earning my money yet...",2,0,2018-01-08 10:38:39,,,3.7.4,en,us

It took a LOT of work to get my accounts to link successfully.   First, I couldn't get authentication codes. Next, if I got authentication codes by text, I'd have to move away from the app to retrieve it, prompting me to try to get a new one, in an endless loop. I finally bypassed this by changing the text preview options on my phone so I could read the code without exiting the app. Even after solving that, I had to restart my phone every time I wanted to add a new account. Annoying, but you only have to set it up once.  Now that I'm in the app and linked up properly, though, it's just getting a bunch of transaction names wrong. For a second, I thought it was alerting me to unauthorized transactions, but no... transactions at Petsmart come up as Midas, charitable donations as lawn care - all things that are clearly stated by my primary account statement... and I can't find a way to correct it, either.

here at PocketGuard we believe that staying on top of your finance should be effortless, therefore, we designed our app to automatically sync with your bank.
We believe someday we may add manual data input. However, for now, there's no way to do so. 
Hope you'll find PocketGuard useful even without manual data input.
