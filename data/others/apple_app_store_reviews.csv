App Store,57877f5e-2dba-4359-bd49-0b8cf916217a,"Let me tell you- all of the previous reviews are old. I‚Äôve been on this app for the since 2019 & will honestly be here until I die. Hoping it lasts that long. üôèüèΩ I‚Äôve been searching for a way to understand my spendings between categories, month over month & watching my budget. This is everything & more. I love the personalization that I can add my own catergories, mark a specific merchant as something once and never have to touch it again & even exclude things like transactions between my accounts. This is the app if you‚Äôre anal about how you spend your money & it even helps if I want to budget for let‚Äôs say shopping. I love it. Please note I am a premium user & to me it‚Äôs worth it. But I‚Äôm sure the free version is equally as good. The other apps mint, your bank, random ones only work if you have a goal. But for me, I want to know where, what & compare my spendings month over month so I can see how I‚Äôm doing. Or if I need to stop spending! 

Anyway highly recommend. And two last things- 1) they‚Äôre IT or support literally responds within 48 hours. You‚Äôre never left hanging and no question is stupid. 2) the app is constantly evolving. It‚Äôs not the same as it was two years ago, it‚Äôs better! If there‚Äôs a bug, report it! If you have a suggestion, suggest it! I love all the latest updates & it really helps me think of how I‚Äôm spending my money which was my ultimate goal. Thank you!!",,,en,us
App Store,66c76bfc-b99a-4b01-938c-4e0407071872,"I‚Äôve literally never written a review for an app before, but I had to because I felt so strongly about the quality of this app. I used mint for a long time bc it was free and got the job done, but recently, Mint stopped supporting my bank (USAA). So, I was on the market for a new budgeting app and stumbled upon PocketGuard. I have to say, I‚Äôm extremely impressed. I love the ability to save for my goals without having to think about it. I love how it calculates my estimated monthly income so that I don‚Äôt have to do the mental math when it comes to budgeting. I love the notifications it gives me when I spend too much on a particular category. I love the customizable budget categories (not an option under Mint). This is truly the greatest budgeting app I‚Äôve ever used, and I‚Äôve been budgeting my money very persistently for about a decade now. Also, the customer service is probably the best I‚Äôve ever come into contact with, across any business or platform. You have a question? Email them and you‚Äôll get a response back within 24 hours. In fact I emailed them once with a question and received a response back within 30 minutes. Overall, this is a fantastic budgeting app and I couldn‚Äôt recommend it more.",,,en,us
App Store,19088734-2bc4-459b-94c1-2c154764b816,"I‚Äôve tried 5 or 6 apps over the years. PocketGuard is the best. I like that I can just assess daily spending, not investments. It is easy enough to use that I do use it, and catching up is easy if I get behind. The team responds to questions quickly and have always answered my questions. There is one merchant that entries frequently default to, even when they are repeated expenditures that PocketGuard should have learned by now. I would like to see a yearly view of my spending categories in addition to monthly; hopefully that is planned. One small thing I would like is to see a number for total food (groceries and eating out combined) somewhere. I am always tracking that, as it‚Äôs the most important area to control. I really like the split transaction feature they added. Overall, PocketGuard has made a dramatic difference in understanding my spending and controlling it. I think I‚Äôve used it for 4 years now and that‚Äôs a record for any financial app except Excel or a brokerage site.",,,en,us
App Store,24b9ba22-41ef-4a4a-bdd8-cf80dff41fea,"Finally! An app that let‚Äôs me track my expenses real time‚Ä¶and accurately! I have tried 14 other budgeting apps in the last year and each one had something buggy about it, or the process flow didn‚Äôt make sense. I used to use Mint but there are too many problems with syncing transactions, etc. This app does all the things I expected the other apps to do and has other cute features (icons for each budget). I‚Äôm sticking with this one from now on. After playing with it for a few hours I bought the annual subscription which is reasonable compared to the other apps I‚Äôve tried. My only request is that the Spending and Budgeting screen should be easier to get to once the app opens, since I use it daily to make sure I‚Äôm staying within each budget category.",,,en,us
App Store,a3ae1093-1caa-472a-87bc-e62ed587ca03,"I love pocketguard, but too frequently there are errors that make it impossible to use. I get the same Error 940 ""Puppetmaster"" error all the time which prevents the app from connecting with my bank. It will sometimes work for a day or two then be in error again for week or so after. Customer support didn't really even respond to my e-mail, just an automated response asking for more details when I literally sent them a screen shot, and it's their own error message. I was considering buying pro, because when it works it's awesome and has literally helped me prevent overdrafts and stick to a budget but it doesn't really work very often. Aside from the broken bits, my recommendation would be the ability to select a date and see how much will be needed for bills in that time frame. It currently only shows end of month, but I always end up needing to bust out paper and pencil and manually (navigating away from the app logs out, so can't even use the calculator app at the same time) add figures to see what I need by next payday, as opposed to month.",,,en,us
App Store,7b986648-d69a-487c-96b6-63795ca966af,"This app has made it so easy to see where our money has gone and is going to go. My new husband and I decided to share accounts and we were struggling to relax into that after independently controlling our finances for so long‚Ä¶ this has made it so much easier! I had to contact customer support one time and they were incredibly prompt and helpful. I knocked off a star because I wish it was able to do the following (but would have only knocked off only half a star if it was an option):

1) I wish you could choose to carry over unspent budgets to the next month. ie If I underspend this month on ‚Äòhome‚Äô, the budget is bigger the following month to purchase a more expensive item.

2) I wish it could learn and adapt. We pay two bills to Banfield Pet Plan each month that come up as BP. When we buy gas from BP, it goes into bills because it think it‚Äôs the same. So a couple of times a month, I have to manuallly change names and categories - sometimes I have to re-enter the banfield bills and then, when they are paid, they don‚Äôt register as the ones planned. This is a niche and minor issue but slightly annoying nonetheless.

3) I wish it was a little more prompt in identifying new transactions. Sometimes the banking app will detail transactions as no longer pending and it‚Äôll take a day or two for them to appear on PocketGuard.

These are minor things that I‚Äôd like the developers to consider BUT overall I love this app!",,,en,us
App Store,c0b38c7a-b613-4580-80d4-4ae2cf2ede3b,"As many people have said it that the app is very good. It logs for most parts of it accurately all the expenses better than other budgeting apps. However where it lags really behind is that they have not figured out a good partnership with the major banks and credit cards on how to get the synchronization perfected to be able to download the transactions seamlessly. I have problems with PNC and American Express. These are two bigger reputable institutions. I hope pocketguard really talks with those institutions and gets this fixed.

If they can get it fixed which I don‚Äôt see why they can‚Äôt  I will surely give them 5 stars. It‚Äôs like the restaurant has a very good atmosphere but if the food is bad somebody may not want to go back. Similarly the app is super good however if the synchronization keeps failing time to time people are going to have to decide and leave because without the transactions being able to be downloaded the app is no good which is so good in other ways. Please please fix. I am counting on PoxketGuard to come through it. Thanks",,,en,us
App Store,7d7e6787-a4d6-4dc4-8eee-8bae4305f11c,"PocketGuard is an excellent budgeting app that helps users keep track of their finances and manage their money with ease.

Overall, PocketGuard is a must-have app for anyone looking to get a better handle on their finances. It offers a range of features and tools to help users manage their money effectively, and its excellent customer service sets it apart from other budgeting apps on the market.",,,en,us
App Store,776b0fcc-ab04-442d-b63a-6a7ffb9ee69e,"I needed an app that would allow me to setup budget categories and monitor my spending (based on accounts I linked to it). It does that and it does it fairly well. I do have to constantly go in everyday to update the category for which it falls in, but I‚Äôm just very particular in how I want my expenditures categorized. I may try using the hashtag feature to simplify things. I also like how it notifies you when you get close to hitting your limits. Moreover it‚Äôs all free! There‚Äôs a paid version to unlock more features, but for me those aren‚Äôt necessary. 

The only downside I‚Äôve noticed is that it doesn‚Äôt update or show your expenditures in real time. Meaning, I usually have to wait 2-3 days before an expense is posted which can be frustrating when needing to know where you stand at any given moment in terms of your budget... which is sort of the purpose of the app right?",,,en,us
App Store,9b1d2efe-b72e-4a7c-8395-fdb27de9f49d,"This app is great if you want something very basic to track your expenses. Bank accounts sync flawlessly, and it is easy to make a custom budget and track purchases.

Where it needs work though is in the integration of the ‚ÄúSpending Limits‚Äù category into the rest of the app. For some reason they have 2 separate categories for ‚ÄúBills‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpending Limits.‚Äù I am sure most people, like me, primarily use the ‚ÄúSpending Limits‚Äù portion which is not really used for any data integration in the rest of the app.

I would like to see ‚ÄúSpending Limits‚Äù integrated into the ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù tab and future monthly income accounted for in the ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù space. It would also be nice to see some changes made in the ‚ÄúInsights‚Äù tab. Ideally, ‚ÄúSpending Limits‚Äù would be broken into macro categories and these macro categories would comprise the pieces of the pie chart under ‚ÄúInsights.‚Äù",,,en,us
App Store,949e87e8-6029-4867-87fa-4e5fdc03dce5,"I really like the idea of having an app that tells you how much is safe to spend without endangering your bills money. It does a pretty good job of categorizing automatically, the need to re-categorize is minimal. However, it‚Äôs detecting one of my savings accounts as checking and I have found no way of changing that. Adding such function would be great. Also, maybe allowing us to add an expense for the future would be nice. I added money to the cash account, which was reserved for a transaction a few days into the future. It didn‚Äôt let me add anything for the future. So I‚Äôll have to come into the app when it happens in October and add it which doesn‚Äôt really make sense. Overall the apps is great, and it‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôve found to what I want which is an app like Level Money which is now gone. There is still room for a few improvements.",,,en,us
App Store,089cc737-02f6-4a19-bae2-f53c1c3123f6,"Every transaction is placed into a specific category (in 9/10 cases it's accurate) so you have a great insight on how much you have spent on coffee shops and books, on clothing and sports etc. Having the full picture will help you to understand how do your spending habits look like now and how do you need to change them. To be honest, it was difficult to stay on budget even after a couple of months of using the app. I was really shocked when having seen my 'in my pocket' negative a week before the next month starts. I couldn't believe I'd overspent with my credit card so much... PocketGuard won't change your life, only you can do it. But this app is a great assistant which definitely makes this change go easier.",,,en,us
App Store,9789d8c1-954f-49d9-9528-a3b55450b809,"I like the concept of PocketGuard, but there are a few elements missing to really make it good- being able to split transactions into different categories (not all my grocery store trips are just for groceries), constant bank connecting issues, and you need to upgrade to categorize certain things (gas, coffee shops, etc). I also noticed I only got push notifications AFTER opening the app- that kinda defeats the purpose of saying ‚Äúhey you‚Äôre close to your budget on ____ don‚Äôt overspend‚Äù. 

I do like that I could connect my main bank and see each account within in it including all of my different shares assigned to that account (checking, savings, trip savings, savings for Christmas, car loan, etc) and decide which to see every log in. The app is very esthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. I did google a few things to figure it how to do it.",,,en,us
App Store,aa2fa7c4-de94-4ade-ae28-60fb85e7f46a,"I absolutely love this app! I used to use the prism app but they started to have system issues and when I tried to address them, I would be waiting over a month to get a response. So I tried this  app called Pocket Guard.  I read a bunch of reviews on a what everyone considered ‚ÄúThe best finance apps‚Äù. This one stuck out to me the most. They really thought about the user interface and how the consumer would have to use the app. I thoroughly enjoy discovering all the features and information this app provides. I don‚Äôt need to use any other app once I set everything up. The customization of categories is such a great feature that I opted to pay the annual subscription rate. Great job Pocket Guard! üëçüèª‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",,,en,us
App Store,3e7ad53d-d8c3-4293-8892-84bb7b98a0bb,"I was recommended to download this app three months ago but decided to leave a review only now. I didn't like the that categories are not totally customized at first, but then technical support gave me several hints on how to use their hashtags system. I wasn't sure it will work for me... But it did! I was able to create multiple spending reports with distinct categories without merging everything into one (#lifestyle report contained Sporting Goods + Gym + Food + Massage). Moreover, you can add multiple hashtags to one transaction and it will make the insights deeper and all-encompassing. they also have additional features related to savings or lowering the bills. I am completely satisfied and definitely will use it in the future.",,,en,us
App Store,90acb1f9-a459-42d1-b50f-6588b0230e34,"I think this app is great overall. Compared to other budgeting tools this is the best one I‚Äôve used. I would even consider upgrading to the subscription, but I have serious problems with how it connects to my bank. My bank requires MFA to connect and so I am constantly needing to re-authorize in order to link the account. First, the notifications are annoying because I‚Äôm reminded of the issue multiple times a day. Second, I never had this issue when I was using Mint or another app for budgeting. I don‚Äôt know if this is a bug, but this is very frustrating because I like the app a lot in every other aspect. I think MFA is important, but I would rather have to do that to log into the app, and not have that be the cause of not syncing between the app and my bank.",,,en,us
App Store,ffab44dc-b6bb-458d-92e0-8e654ae45483,"I reaallly want this app to be my go to budgeting tool. It has the best UI/UX of any app I‚Äôve ever tried, it‚Äôs so great to use. But unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt sync up with your card transactions very well. 

I have ‚Äúpending transactions‚Äù from over a week ago that are definitely not pending anymore on my credit card. It also labels pending purchases with the incorrect vendor. I think PocketGuard has trouble with transactions that have tips? For example I went to a restaurant a week ago, but PocketGuard still says it‚Äôs pending and has the wrong merchant. It seems to mix up the merchant with previous purchases. Along with this, it‚Äôs missing some transactions from last week.

Mint doesn‚Äôt have this issue, all my transactions are there, none of them are incorrectly labeled as pending, and all the vendors are accurate.

There‚Äôs so many thing PocketGuard does right, but I can‚Äôt justify using it for budgeting when the transactions take forever to correct itself. I would gladly pay for a subscription if this wasn‚Äôt an issue. When it works, it works really well. 

Maybe I‚Äôll try again in a couple of months and see if anything improves. I really hope it does!!",,,en,us
App Store,d3954a71-f54f-407c-814e-4bed9e43d41c,"This program is difficult to use. My wife and I both use it on our joint account, but our ‚Äúin my pocket‚Äù amount rarely matches. It jumps around wildly over the course of the day as well so we literally never know how much we have. It‚Äôs difficult to figure out how to handle things like using your bonus from last month since finances reset every month. It‚Äôs also difficult to figure out how to handle periodic expenses. 

Mint tells you how much you have left and how many days remain, so while it doesn‚Äôt give you a ‚Äúdaily number‚Äù you can easily divide cash remaining by days remaining. Mints balance matches for my wife and I and doesn‚Äôt have wild swings throughout the day. We feel much more confident using that program which just very simple math without any weird issues. It‚Äôs easy to see where money is and where it went.

I can not recommend this program.",,,en,us

I didn‚Äôt think of it much at first so I waited a few hours and tried again. Same problem. I was slightly annoyed but I understand sometimes things like this happen. I submitted a request to support. Got a generic message saying please detail the issue. I replied back but still haven‚Äôt got an answer. I‚Äôve been trying every day now and it‚Äôs still giving me the same issue and still no answer from customer service. Not even someone messaging back saying ‚Äúwe are working on this‚Äù or ‚Äúsorry about that this connection going to be down for a while. We will let you know when it‚Äôs up and running‚Äù.

BUT, I‚Äôve got to tell you, after taking a few days or so to get my feet wet to truly understand this app and learn how to navigate my way through it, I love it! My favorite features:
‚Äì upcoming bills. It‚Äôs a feature that I have sorely been missing,Knowing what bills are coming up and when is key for making sure I‚Äôve got enough money in the bank to avoid overdraft payments. Super easy the way I have it set up, on the overview page I have a section that includes all my fixed costs for the month, easy to see and easy to categorize. Makes it super easy to budget what I have left over.
- hashtags.I love the hashtags, never been easier to see how much I spent on back to school stuff , on my recent vacation, etc.
-Love the easy comparison from one month to the next to see if I spent more than less than the previous month in a particular category.

There‚Äôs more, but suffice it to say that I found the app that works for me. 

My only qualm is that I wish you could customize the color scheme. I‚Äôd like a lighter color scheme.",,,en,us
App Store,ac62aeff-3a39-41ee-89d4-e39f193b6fb0,"I have used every budgeting and spending app offered since 2003.  By far, this is the most straightforward and user friendly app I‚Äôve used.  I hope it never goes away, I‚Äôve paid for the premium version to get the absolute most out of the app.  My 81 year old mother now uses the app, she also loves it.  

I reference the app multiple times a day, I can easily reference what bills are still outstanding without use of a calculator or downloading an excel file, although I can if needed.  I can easily show my husband our spending trends and cash flow.  I have gradually added more to the app and we are now tracking net worth.  It is a breeze.",,,en,us

So when I decided to finally start, I deleted the app and looked again and this Budget Planner was my first choice. I was surprised by how quick and easy it is to use, intuitive, with a customizable yet simple interface, and mostly, informative.

For example, it only counts venmo transactions towards a budget when I pay other people, but not when I'm paid (which creates problems when I pay the bill at dinner and others pay me back, it's artificially inflating my dining expenses when I am not overspending myself). Another example is that I made some returns to a store the other day, and I see the positive transaction categorized under ""shopping"", but it is not reducing the amount that I've spent on shopping by that amount, so it also is overstating what I've spent in that category.

The updates from bank accounts with merchant info and the ability to split the receipt into multiple categories.

App Store,dd092979-f470-49ad-8e2a-1d51c2f969c3,"This app is a really cool idea and if it worked well I‚Äôd continue my paid subscription. However, there are a couple big issues: 
- It‚Äôs really slow - almost unusable. This seems newer. When I first started using it it wasn‚Äôt this slow. Just scrolling through transactions is so tedious because it freezes and then scrolls way further than you want 
- It doesn‚Äôt always catch when your accounts are out out of date or not updating. For example, I have one account that just won‚Äôt seem to update any transactions from the last 6 months but PocketGuard isn‚Äôt showing any errors with the connection. This type of ‚Äòsilent‚Äô failure to update really takes away from the value  because I can‚Äôt trust what I see in the app.
-There also seems to be pretty frequent errors with accounts where I have to remove and re-add them or re-enter credentials. This is probably more related to the external accounts and their security but it‚Äôs still annoying. 

All in all, I find myself using the actual bank apps more than PocketGuard due to these issues even though I‚Äôd prefer to have it all in one place and use PocketGuard.",,,en,us

A number of banks are not able to sync (Apple card, Ellevest) which causes for inaccurate info, the desktop application is exceptionally slow preforming, and there are a few features that could use tweaking (like the ability to recognize transactions and associate them using ‚Äòto‚Äô and ‚Äòfrom‚Äô).

App Store,f6262b11-b880-401b-988b-3e1bd436ddbd,"I love using PocketGuard for tracking my day to day spending and making sure I have enough to cover my bills. It‚Äôs fairly intuitive and is better for day to day tracking than things like personal capital. 

However, there are a couple things that don‚Äôt work quite right or as expected. 

Firstly, pending transaction are taken out of your ‚Äúpocket‚Äù but can‚Äôt be modified or attributed to bills. It can take quite a while for some transactions to be marked as cleared, which means that often times my ‚Äúpocket‚Äù is wildly inaccurate, since it‚Äôs counting large bills like my rent effectively twice. That kind of defeats the purpose of the tool. 

Secondly (and this may have more to do with the financial institution), but there are certain accounts that are listed as addable, but simple aren‚Äôt. My savings account, for example, hasn‚Äôt been able to sync for 6 months and the error is just a vague ‚Äúsomething went wrong.‚Äù Mind you it syncs fine on other budgeting apps.

I love the spending limits feature but **wish there was a weekly option as well!** When you get paid bi-weekly monthly budgets are very difficult to plan because paychecks never hit on the same dates. The ability to monitor weekly spending and stay in my budgeting limits would be a game changer and I would definitely pay for a pro account if that was an option.",,,en,us

The app itself offers plenty of features but it‚Äôs not very user friendly. Adding some tutorials would be nice. Getting rid of the Find Savings tab would be nice as well. Overall this app just throws a lot of information at you and doesn‚Äôt really show you how any of it is connected very well for you to actually manage your budget properly.

This isn‚Äôt too much of a problem for me, bc I can keep track of this myself. I just wish I could add my store credit cards.

- let‚Äôs me adjust dates on transactions which is nice because my paycheck for a month sometimes comes in the next month which can mess up my data
- auto savings as well as auto saving from each pay check 
- a lot of categories to choose from for transactions 
- merchant history which allows you to see past monthly spending on one category

CONS: 
- I don‚Äôt know why some transactions aren‚Äôt showing up and it really screws with my income vs spending graphs

App Store,064214fc-d95d-4552-9970-d421d628e99c,"So I‚Äôm a very skeptical person when it comes to believing that the app is going to be true to not selling your information or gaining too much access to your bank account or even having to wonder if your money is safe but I went ahead and I put my account information and it was great. So I decided let‚Äôs do it again for my other bank account but my other bank doesn‚Äôt even exist in the system I thought all banks were going to be excepted but apparently not.

So if there‚Äôs one thing I would like for the developers to change that would be it. The fact that they don‚Äôt have my bank in the system is kind of dumb. Ok now I know a lot of people probably haven‚Äôt even heard of my bank it‚Äôs probably something that only exists in my area but still I wish it would be in the system. I use Apple Federal credit bank and I typed it in but nothing showed up. So if you (the developers) could start adding some smaller branch banks in to the system that would be really helpful to linking my account and accurately being able to make a budget and use the app like it‚Äôs supposed to be used. But since you don‚Äôt have the bank that I use in the system I can‚Äôt really use the app like it‚Äôs supposed to be used for because after I got married it turned out that my primary bank account ended up being Apple not BB&T and it‚Äôs not in the system so how am I supposed to be able to use this app if I can‚Äôt link my bank account to get accurate numbers on my budget goals and spending allowance? 
So if you (the developers) could make that change to adding smaller branches into your system that would be more than appreciated and helpful. Thanks",,,en,us

App Store,07f7c070-b626-4b5e-9837-a79d394d6c55,"I really wanted to keep using the pocketguard app. Great design, showing prominently how much I could allow myself to spend for the week or month. I spent hours categorizing my transactions so the app could group my expenses properly. But none of that mattered because a core function of the app does not work. A couple weeks after setting up the app, I started noticing that the app was missing multiple transactions from multiple accounts. Meaning that the budgets and quite literally all the calculated data in the app was incorrect! I reached out to app‚Äôs support team but after after weeks of back and forth, the only solution they provided was to use a feature of the paid version of the app to manually add the transactions as cash transactions and then delete the transactions when they fix the problem at some undetermined time in the future. I was even willing to go that route, but the support person could not give me any timeline when the problem would be fixed. In short, the app is broken to the point of being unusable with no fix on the timeline. A further point, they said the issue is with their data aggregator‚Äôs problem with my account issuer and that the problem is affecting a large number of their users. The accounts are with Chase, one of the largest banking networks in the states. I don‚Äôt see how the developers can keep soliciting app downloads and subscriptions when they have such a major flaw with the app that affects so many of their customers while having no timeline to resolve. That‚Äôs very irresponsible so this is definitely not a developer anyone should trust with their finances. If you‚Äôre using this app, please verify your transactions against your account statements so you don‚Äôt overspend based on the app‚Äôs incorrect data. There are other budgeting apps available that are far more reliable.",,,en,us

App Store,5ff77e7c-b1ce-46fe-abf0-8c70ba5343ce,"Overall this app is great! I am single, and have been looking for a budgeting app that will help me with spending habits. (I love to shop and get carried away sometimes üòú) I have tried a few different ones so far and this one is the best. I will give a couple of reasons I didn‚Äôt give it a full 5 stars under ‚ÄúCons‚Äù. 

Pros: 
1) My accounts will update automatically. This is huge for me because when I used the Mint app, this was not the case. If I had a ‚Äúpending‚Äù purchase in my checking account it would not show on the Mint app, but that is not the case here. I can see all my purchases as soon as I swipe my card. 
2) I am a sucker for a full chart breakdown of my spending, and this app is full of them. 
3) If you need to see QUICKLY how much money you have on hand (for example if your fixing to check out) you can do that under the ‚ÄúIn My Pocket‚Äù amount. 
4) I cannot explain it, but this app has trained me in such a way that I do not usually make a purchase without looking at it first, which is exactly what I need (again I don‚Äôt have great spending habits ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). 

Cons: 
1) The look of the app itself is not as ‚Äúclean‚Äù as I believe it could be. This is minor because it is so functional, but an example would be the pie chart. I love that it shows this, but I wish it was color coded or had something to help each section to stand out more than just the pictures. Another thing that would clean it up is the titles. Please capitalize EVERYTHING that needs to be capitalized. Punctuation is everything. 
2) I live in a rural area so this may have something to do with my issue, but I have had to edit a number of transactions that were not even close to what they actually were. For example, I went to Walmart to buy Groceries, but the transaction was labeled as CVS. These stores are miles from each other. It doesn‚Äôt bother me so much because, again, the app is very functional and easy to edit, but I mention it because if it weren‚Äôt for my bank/Discover app I would be screwed. 

I know this review is long, but I hope it helps. Thank you for providing a system that makes my life so much easier!

Update: If I could bring it back down to 3 stars I would. App is not updating my accounts like it was at first. This has become annoying because the account is days behind and my budgets are not completely up-to-date. Not sure how much longer I‚Äôm going to use this one if this problem continues.",,,en,us

App Store,13ac0b74-ba96-4cb4-a0ce-143388ad7aab,"*UPDATE* Been using the app for a few months now and multiple transactions from my citi card are frequently missing. It is an ongoing support issue that has yet to be fixed and makes the app useless. 

I‚Äôve tried multiple other apps for budgeting (Mint, YNAB, Quickbook, etc.) but found most to be either too complicated or more focused on working down debt. I wanted something that could: sync my accounts, keep track of transactions, and help me limit spending on different categories- and this app has been perfect for that. 

Positives: Learning to use the app has been quick and easy, able to add multiple bank accounts, credit card payments are automatically excluded from calculations which helps organize transactions, easy to re-label transactions to different budgets, I can see the free version being sufficient for a lot of users, paid version is a reasonable one time fee instead of a yearly subscription. 

Critiques: Would prefer the ‚Äúspending & budgets‚Äù category as a tab on the bottom instead of the ‚Äúfind savings‚Äù tab (which is basically an ad you can‚Äôt get rid of even with a paid account), difficult to set up multiple ‚Äúgoals‚Äù if you only have one savings account, only able to set a budget for a month- would be great to set a yearly budget for big things like travel, home improvement, etc., 
difficulty adding one of my bank accounts (resolved by adding through website instead of mobile app), and this is very minor but aesthetics are a little dated. Being able to choose your own colors, light vs dark mode, updated icons, etc. could really go a long way. 

Overall, I highly recommend this app and am planning on staying with it for the foreseeable  future.",,,en,us

App Store,5af28add-d784-496e-805b-2a6da74f6557,"I am a Plus user and I love the UI/features, however there are some flaws that make me want to use a different app for budgeting purposes and cancel my subscription:

1. I do not get reminder notifications for upcoming bills even though I have notifications turned on for the app. According to PocketGuard you are supposed to receive a notification 3 days before my bill is due but I am not getting that. Also there is no setting for this reminder, you cannot adjust how far in advance this ‚Äúreminder‚Äù occurs.

2. This app does not seem smart enough to handle credit card bills. Every credit card bill is variable, therefore what I paid last month will not be the same this month. PocketGuard acknowledges this by saying ‚Äúthis bill fluctuates‚Äù, however there is an issue with this. When you create the credit card bill from the transaction of you paying it, it will input how much you paid for that bill as how much it should be every month. When the next month bill is due, if I pay a different amount PocketGuard does not recognize that and will tell me my credit card bill is over due, when it is not. This could just be a bug, but still very annoying and I expected better from an app you must pay to use all its features.

3. Transactions from my debit and credit card are really delayed. Any transaction (even pending ones) take 3-4 days after they appear on either account to even show up on PocketGuard. This is not a bank issue as the same accounts are used on the Mint app show up right away, so why does PocketGuard have an issue? This delay causes me issues with budgeting and defeats one of the purposes of the app, tracking how much money is in your pocket each day.

Complaint #3 is probably my biggest gripe, as the first two may just be bugs or just something that can be improved on.",,,en,us
App Store,80f11828-4e2e-4641-bb2a-93973ea5fa78,"The interface is aesthetically pleasing and mostly easy-to-use (though I can‚Äôt stand that Apple Wallet wannabe accounts view - why let me reorder the list of accounts if you‚Äôre just going to put them back in your own order when I refresh?), but functionally this app could definitely be better. 

I spent a long time setting it up including going back through 5+ months of imported transactions and cleaning them up with correct categories/tags, identifying recurring bills, etc, only to have it continually miscategorize some of those aforementioned bills even though it should ‚Äúknow‚Äù what they are already, forcing me to rename and recategorize the same things over and over.

The snapshot view - the main reason I went with this one over the countless other similar apps - is useless as well, since PocketGuard artificially inflates some of my upcoming bill amounts seemingly at random, leaving the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in my pocket‚Äù numbers consistently in the red no matter how much I ‚Äútruly have available.‚Äù

The transactions view seems to try and ‚Äúguess‚Äù the name of a new vendor, but instead of interpreting the information it is given (i.e. the vendor name fed to it by the vendor itself), it adds words seemingly out of nowhere, making me think I‚Äôm seeing a fraudulent transaction until I cross-reference my transactions with my bank. For example, a purchase from ‚ÄúCircle Wine and Spirits‚Äù showed up in PocketGuard as ‚ÄúCircle K‚Äù - there are no Circle K locations anywhere near me, so you can see how I‚Äôd be concerned!

I‚Äôve sunk a lot of time into trying to make this work already so I‚Äôll give it some more time in the hopes that it gets a little ‚Äúsmarter,‚Äù but I‚Äôll be jumping ship soon if the experience doesn‚Äôt improve.",,,en,us

App Store,ef233552-9e28-40ae-9385-ed190ee804d1,"First of all, please keep in mind that I'm looking for a replacement for an app called ""Prosper Daily"".  This app started out with the name BillGuard and then was bought out by Prosper.  After about 2 years, Prosper has decided to shut it down.  I loved this app because it allowed automatic connection to my credit cards (much like PocketGuard does), but with one great feature!  It also allowed me to reconcile my credit cards with an simple swiping method.  This is a feature that I think must be in included in PocketGuard for me to jump on board!  If anyone from PocketGuard is reading this review, please hop on over to Prosper Daily, download the app, and see how this reconciliation works. If you do so, you need to do it soon as Prosper Daily will stop working all together on August 31.  I know there are many people who are more than willing to pay for this feature (a feature that admittedly was free with Prosper Daily, and maybe should not have been).  This would be so helpful!

The other issue I have with  PocketGuard is that I have a Barclays MasterCard and every time I answer the security questions, I get an error saying that the security questions are answered wrong.  The specific error message I get is as follows:  ""Missing or Incorrect MFA Answer"".  I know I am not answering my questions wrong because I have been able to get into the site and actually hook up ProperDaily to it.  I will try to reach out to customer support to see if I can get this problem fixed.

Anyway, I think there is a ton of potential with this app, and like I said, I would be more than willing to pay for the Plus package to get this.  I guess I will have to wait to see what PocketGuard decides to do here.

UPDATE:  Is there any chance of getting a transaction reconciliation option like Prosper Daily had?  I cannot find an app on the App Store that does this and it would be awesome if this app had the option to reconcile if you wanted to.",,,en,us

App Store,6a2a01a4-ad04-4c18-94bb-d316f3a40cc1,"I still really want to like this app, because it does exactly what I want, in theory. But in practice, it‚Äôs really not working. I‚Äôve been working with it for a few months, but I‚Äôm about done. 

Things that I‚Äôve marked as ‚Äúbills‚Äù constantly drop off, and I have to figure out what is missing. I‚Äôve had older transactions just disappear. I feel like I‚Äôm constantly having to double check that everything is right, and constantly having to make adjustments and contact support, which is making money management harder, not easier. 

It takes way too long to reconcile a pending transaction as a bill. You have to wait till it is no longer pending, which means you can be hanging out for 3 days with an inaccurate ‚Äúin my pocket‚Äù figure. 

You can‚Äôt change dates, and transactions often get stuck onto the date they clear rather than the date they happen. So if you do something right on the cusp of one month, it will probably end up attached to the next month. Sure, for small things, this doesn‚Äôt matter, but when it‚Äôs a $2000 transaction, it really does. 

It also doesn‚Äôt deal with positive transactions, which seems like a pretty essential function. So if you have a return at a store, foot the bill and have your friends pay you back, or get a credit for anything, it just doesn‚Äôt count. 

I‚Äôve stuck with it this long because it is exactly how I want to be visualizing my money. And I do have to say that support is usually very helpful and works to try to fix things. But overall, it‚Äôs not working as well as it should.",,,en,us

I like that the app makes it so easy to categorize my expenses, if I even need to (the auto-categorization function works great). I appreciate that the app doesn't request/require me to setup budgets or spending plans, which is not how I use these finance apps. I primarily use finance apps to simply review my charges and ensure that nothing suspect hits my account. The budgeting tools are available for those who like those, though, which is nice.

Overall, I'm very, very impressed. Great work PocketGuard! Looking forward to using this app!",,,en,us
App Store,256f6de8-d5e1-4c4a-84d8-274ab01d6961,"PocketGuard is an excellent app with great features; if you need something to track your monthly budget I would highly recommend it‚Ä¶¬†with some caveats:

1. Certain account connections seems to be consistently unreliable. Two of my accounts in particular repeatedly have connection issues; when I go to fix them, the app claims the credentials are incorrect (I know for sure the credentials are correct), then appears to connect anyway. Hours later it will be disconnected again, however, and I'll have to go through the same hoops. I contacted support about this, but received no response.

2. The automated bill trackings ‚Äì¬†while nice ‚Äì¬†is not perfect, and with no way to manually correct the issues this can cause a lot of problems. For example, let's say you and your partner both have student loans from the same lender, and make your payments on roughly the same day each month. I have this exact setup through two different lenders (four bill payments total), but PocketGuard *always* merges the payments so that it looks like there's only one bill payment to each lender. Depending on what your loan payments are, this could result in wildly inaccurate ""In Your Pocket"" estimates (as two whole bills go uncounted). I've contacted support about this and am srill waiting for a response.",,,en,us
App Store,0fad3044-7592-41bc-a064-02dfe582003d,"Users didn't ask for this update! Free version was able to use more pockets until this last update. Update is misleading and makes me question the business ethics of this company. They lead you to believe more pockets were added but now you have to pay to use all the pockets that once were free. Don't think that is really fair to take away features that once were free especially for early users of the app. Also changed all of my spending limits. Can't wait until Olivia app is out so I can stop using this one. $4/month or $35/yr seems overpriced for apps today. A one time fee seems more reasonable. I thought their revenue stream came from negotiating lower rates on certain bills and keeping a portion of the savings. I guess that model proved unsustainable.

Edit: You didn't add more features with the Premium version. You took the majority of pockets that prior to the update were free and now make them only available in the Premium paid version. Pretty sneaky.

Edit2: That is not correct. The pockets I had access to for free but are no longer available with the free version are Mortgage&Rent, Home Furnishings, Charity, Fast Food, Gas&Fuel, and Student Loans.",,,en,us
App Store,b6077689-2590-4d30-90fa-c3fd87262f91,"I really like this app and its accompanying website. It did a great job dealing with my bank's complicated way of showing transactions (they use a zero-sum system transferring money between checking and a HELOC). However, I won't be using it for two big reasons:
1. You are not allowed to manually enter a transaction (e.g. When you pay cash for something). I contacted support to check and they confirmed this. While easily 90%+ of my transactions occur electronically in one form or another, keeping track of my cash is probably the hardest part of budgeting and what I really wanted an app to do. 
2. You cannot split transactions between two or more categories. So, I go to the atm and grab $100 cash because I need to put $25 in a birthday card for my niece, $20 for gas (paying cash is cheaper), stopping for bagels $10, etc.  There's no way for me to allocate that $100 into multiple categories.

I like that Pocket Guard does this for you. I also appreciate the graphs. They almost make it feel like a game to try and keep them in balance. I feel like Pocket Guard may be a little more accurate than some of the other budgeting app. I'm very excited for the savings feature, but until then, I'm trying out digit.",,,en,us

I had a few issues with it...first, it separated food from restaurants and groceries. I budget for food in general. I get paid every 2 weeks and Id get alerts saying things like ""you've spent $xxx above your income this week"". I pay housing online but it may leave my bank anywhere from the 28th to the 3rd of the following month. It hit twice in one month simply due to timing and it showed I was off budget for housing. I paid my cc bill from my checking so in the time it left my bank until it posted to my cc, I was getting messages about overspending. Overall, my issue was all related to timing. I wanted an app that would let me look back at the end of the month and see where my money went. This did not do that.",,,en,us
App Store,f85ce22e-4ef1-45f7-8986-a16ba87c175a,"I like the concept.   Instead of trying to log every transaction into different envelopes or buckets which can be very tedious, this just tells you how much you can spend in given day or week so you don't run out of money.  At least that's what it's supposed to do.  Problem is that transactions aren't read from your bank account in real time and are loaded in batches that may or may not reflect the actual date of the transaction.  So you could have a situation where it downloads a week's worth of transactions and puts them all on the current date thus showing you have like -$600 to spend on that day when if you actually calculate your balance by the number of days till your next paycheck you are obviously very much in the positive.

App Store,b449215e-bdc2-49c2-8b1c-5d9a833d0360,"They just added a cool new way to view your net income compared to spending and bills.

So your bills gets subtracted twice! This renders the new feature completely useless. What a horrible error to make too in a program like this. I can't believe it was missed. For instance, say I payed 1,000 in bills and spent an additional 500 in stuff and made an income of 1500. It says that I spent 1500 because it includes the bills. So for the spent number it says 1500, for the bills it says 1,000 and for income it says 1,500. Now it calculates incorrectly the net income by subtracted the spent number and the bills from the income saying that I have a net income of -1,000 when really it should be 0!",,,en,us

I get paid once a month, in the middle of the month, and when I get paid that's when my budget ""month"" restarts.

Bill transactions that are pending are still rolled into the budget. This kills the app. I have all my bills deducted within the first half of the month. Only when the bill transaction posts is it marked as a bill automatically and my budget adjusts to the correct amount. It's completely out of whack and I have no idea what's in my pocket sometimes. 

Their support team seems to not exist. I hesitated to post this review but after 4 attempts to contact them they do not reply.

It's fantastic! It actually does a few things better than Level did. Way better categories sorting. It auto categories everything for you so you don't need to create spending lists. Monthly bill detection works great. Account setup is easy. 

The one thing they need to add to get my review up to 5 stars is an ability to add an amount you want to save each month. Right now it only gives you income -monthly bills. This looks to be on their roadmap.",,,en,us

App Store,6262b15d-ef4f-4747-b7ac-fcd4809ca71a,"What attracted me to this app was that it would tell you how much money you have left over after all your expenses were paid.  I had hoped this would be the one and only budgeting app I would ever need. 
Well where do I start? First off, while it automatically updates my chase bank info, it doesn‚Äôt automatically update my Navy FCU. I have request a code, then wait for this app to let me enter the code which takes at least a minute. Once it has the code then it takes about 20 seconds or more to update.  All other apps continue to sync whereas PocketGuard gets amnesia. This is a big fail which the company really needs to work on. 
The second issue I have is the app predicting how much and when my next paycheck will be. I get paid by the law firm on the 15th and 30th of every month but if the day falls on a weekend then I‚Äôm paid on the Friday or Monday. You can‚Äôt program the app to adjust for this. Second, hours paid changes depending how many days are in a month. I.E. 30 vs 31st vs 28. While my hours are consistent, the payout varies according to the calendar. Simply put, some pay periods have one extra day or less a day or even. This app doesn‚Äôt account for those variations or allow to to program that algorithm. 
In comparison to Mint, Experian, NerdWallet, and WalletHub, PocketGuard ranks in the bottom of my list. So far down the list in that when I‚Äôm done with this review, I will delete it and not recommend it to anyone.",,,en,us
App Store,60fc8095-4a3f-4908-9f82-3107d921096c,"I like this app generally. Easy to use and can help provide a comprehensive financial picture if one doesn‚Äôt experience bank-connection issues.Also really love the feature that other apps like Mint do not have of being able to save a retailer to one category and never worry about it again.

However I have not been able to link to Citibank even though I‚Äôve tried repeatedly with the right password.The password checks out, and then it goes to a screen that claims it‚Äôs connecting with the bank but sits there for more than five minutes. I‚Äôve tried to connect at least 10x. 

Reached out to customer service and they told me I didn‚Äôt use the right bank password (and that I should ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù) as if I‚Äôm an idiot.

Will not pay for a full year and will discontinue use since this prevents me from actually seeing my entire financial outlook on that app.",,,en,us

App Store,5c5b6a89-a0df-4028-afaa-bedb84ef405f,"First off, your product teams and developers are just inconsiderate and maybe lazy. Why would you make a user stare at a grey screen for 2-5 minutes when linking accounts? Why do I have to stay on that screen. If I leave, the app times out and I have to start over, staring at a grey screen wasting my life. Also, when your app asks for the confirmation code from the account you are linking, don‚Äôt you think the user will need to leave the app and check and email or text? Oh you did think? Then why does your app freak out, end the account linking process and make you start over, staring at a grey screen? Just plane rude.

Only after I delete the account and re-add it to the app, does it display the correct amount. I‚Äôve had the app for almost a year, and there were no issues in the beginning.

Hi - I‚Äôve been using PocketGuard for a couple months now and absolutely love it - especially the Level-like features that I‚Äôve been missing for so long!

HOWEVER I‚Äôm not sure what happened in the last couple of weeks but I have not been able to get past the launch screen (not sure if that‚Äôs the technical term but it‚Äôs the all gray background with the PocketGuard logo in the center) to access my transactions, insights, etc. on the iOS app. It is all there when I go on my laptop through a web browser - so no account connection issues.
