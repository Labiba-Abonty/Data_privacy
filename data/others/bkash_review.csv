arman hossain,"April 4, 2023","Its a well designed app. But its a request to add a option or feature, so that the old balance is shown somewhere in the app. It would be much beneificial if we can see both the old amount in the account and the new one too. Hope you will bring the update soon, waiting for that one. When money comes in, the entire total amount is shown, sometimes its needed to remember the old amount. Thank you.",bKash Limited,"April 4, 2023","Thank you for your suggestion. From the ""Statement"" option of your bKash app, you can check the last 30 days' transaction statement. And if you have liked using the bKash app, we request that you reconsider your rating.

Mahfujur Rahman,"November 1, 2020","For me , without a doubt this is a five star app. It works perfectly, i never faced any problems or bugs so far, and I've been using it for long time. But i would very much like to see fingerprint support in this app, so we can easily make transitions, and also could avoid the risk of someone seeing our pin code. It'd be more secure that way.",bKash Limited,"November 1, 2020","Thanks for leaving us such a wonderful review.

A Google user,"September 16, 2019","So disappointed with this update. I'm not being able to log in since the update. The OTP verification doesn't work at all, neither automatic detection nor manual input is working. I'm using the registered number on SIM slot 1 and all permissions are given, still no luck. The updated interface is even more disappointing, it's very cluttered and not user friendly at all. Expecting an immediate fix followed by a better interface.",bKash Limited,"September 16, 2019",We are so sorry to hear that you are facing such problem. We request you to contact us at support@bKash.com. So that we can work on it.
A Google user,"February 10, 2020","Present (13/9/19): I am a beta tester of the new redesigned app. It's terrible to say the least. The UI frequently changing which is confusing. Finding things has gotten exponentially difficult. It's constantly asking for Google Location Services to be on which is annoying. Past: Really awesome app for regular payment. Secure, hassle free and fast. Really nice UI and full of important features. I have a few feature requests!",bKash Limited,"February 26, 2020",We are sad to hear that you didn’t get the best experience.  We hope for a future opportunity to make this right for you. We’d love to continue providing great experience.
A Google user,"September 24, 2019",The previous version was far better. Almost every functions that had in the previous version still exists. Only the outlook has changed and few more functions and extra facilities has been added. I admit that. But the main issue is this latest version has added more and more bugs. After pressing bksh app icon i can rarely enter into the app one or two times out of minimum 20 times. It just keep loading and loading. The other thing I don't understand what's the use of adding gps system?,bKash Limited,"September 24, 2019",Sir you are requested to go to App Setting and clear your cache/data in order to minimize these problem.
A Google user,"October 30, 2019","This latest update is the worst and slowest. Please make it simple, user friendly and above all faster. The app can not be started if the GPS is off. So, it does not matter at all what options you have added or what new feauters you have introduced. If users cannot start the app faster, all your new features are useless. Please make it simple and faster.",bKash Limited,"October 31, 2019","Thank you for your review. We are sorry to hear you had such an unsatisfying experience, but we really appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention. We always aim to deliver a great experience. We want to make sure your voice is heard as we continue to improve. Again, thank you for your feedback."
A Google user,"October 17, 2019","New interface is just a garbage. Slow and buggy. Why you need location service for mobile money? Revised: Please give us the old app back with the add-on features. We really don't need a fancy app which doesn't work at all. My personal recommendation is, disable location tracking feature, which I believe creates most of the problems.",bKash Limited,"November 7, 2019",Using the new bKash app you can learn about all the services of bKash and location based offers. People can create a bKash account on their own and a QR scan button below the home screen has also been added which allows you to do transactions easily.
A Google user,"September 16, 2019","Have tried to self register with the new version at least for an hour. Each time the app shows some system error at various stages of registration. After trying for 10/12 times, have given up.

A Google user,"October 19, 2019","The latest update is completely boring and disturbing even while I'm trying to put the pin number then the app just act as not responsive. The previous version was far better than this stupid version. I think without proper homework it is not wise to launch the new update, and please don't experiment it upon the user and don't play with our time. We don’t have enough time to be waiting for this freak! Try to solve this problem otherwise bring back the previous version.

MD Al Arman Sorker,"June 23, 2023",It is giving too much unnecessary notification. That is very annoying. If I turn off the notification of this app through the phone's setting then it will not notified me when I get any trajection. Then what to do! This is very disgusting.

Siam Abdullah,"July 7, 2023","Start by basic things!! You are doing almost everything without even thinking how many people get scammed just by trusting online payment through this app. And you can't even get any help through police or anything because of this online system. Get a security system for yourself first! Many people get scammed a lot of money and never get them back. There should be a safe COD locker system through bkash. For after delivery, just a confirmation click there could be a safe money",,,
